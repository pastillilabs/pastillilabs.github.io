At last we got a decent(_ish_) web site!

While it is nothing super fancy, it at least allows adding and editing content more easily as needed and when requested.

Of course there is now this ['news blog']({{ site.baseurl }}/news) where we can share information about releases and other stuff. But most importantly there is also a ['FAQ']({{ site.baseurl }}/faq) section where you can find answers to most commonly asked questions. If you have more questions or the existing answers are not clear enough, please do **[send us feedback via the provided channels]({{ site.baseurl }}/about#contact)**.

Perhaps the site will even get a proper app usage instructions section at some point :)
