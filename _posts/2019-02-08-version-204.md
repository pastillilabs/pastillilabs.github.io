New version of **Situations** is now available for **[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pastillilabs.situations2)**!

This release (3.1.204) contains following changes:
- BT Pro condition: Added "Any connection", slightly re-arranged UI
- Fixed import for purchased plugins
- Fixed location plugin on Android 9
- Fixed random crashing issues
- Added support for arm64 architecture
- Updated application framework & libraries

Same update, containing the BT Pro plugin update, will be available for Sailfish soon.

There have been some stability issues on Android lately. Hopefully this release fixes at least some if not all of those. In case of continued problems, please do send feedback to our [support e-mail](mailto:support@pastillilabs.com).
