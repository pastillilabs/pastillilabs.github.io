We received a completely new translation contribution from Poland - so now Situations is also available in Polish. Big thank you to [Aleksander Burzec](https://github.com/InYourHead){:target="_blank"} for providing it!!

While gaining support for new langauges is great, many of the other [currently provided translations](https://pastillilabs.com/resources/#credits) are slighty out of date. If you notice missing translations or just something to correct in any of the currently provided language that you happen to be using, please don't hesitate to send fixes to us.

Complete instructions for contributing are available [here](https://pastillilabs.com/resources/#translations). But any size and form of contribution via any of the available channels is welcome :)

At this point, special thanks go to [Ã…ke Engelbrektson](http://svenskasprakfiler.se){:target="_blank"} for having kept the Swedish translations well up-to-date!
