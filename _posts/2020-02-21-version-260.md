Today we've made Situations version 3.2.260 officially available for **[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pastillilabs.situations2)**.

This version mainly improves compatibility with Android 10. Import & export of settings should work again, although the files will be read from & written to 'Download' folder instead. Also Launch & URL actions work again within the limits imposed by the platform. When device is being used, apps won't just automatically get started by Situations. Instead, a notification will be shown and tapping the notification will start the app.
