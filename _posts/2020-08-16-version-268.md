Situations 3.2.268 is now available for **[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pastillilabs.situations2)**.

Accessory plugin had an issue working correctly in combination with other conditions. This is now fixed. A couple situation icons (day & night) were added based on feedback and Wallpaper action now uses native Android image picker - which is required for compatibility with future Android versions.

All changes in this release:
- Fix to accessory plugin behavior when combined with other plugins
- Use native image picker for Wallpaper
- Show "empty" label for empty plugin categories
- Day & Night icons
- Update app framework & other dependencies
