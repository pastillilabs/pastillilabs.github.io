Today we've made Situations version 3.2.258 officially available for **Sailfish OS**.

This version adds SMS Send action - which requires **[Sonar](https://pastillilabs.com/sonar)** to be installed. There is also a much requested fix for Network Cells condition. It should work again on all hardware (with cellular connections).
