A small update of Situations with version 3.2.280 is gradually becoming available for both **[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pastillilabs.situations2)** and Sailfish OS.

While there's darkness rising in the east, in this update we are nevertheless introducing a Daylight condition that activates between the lunar sunrise & sunset of your current - or freely selected - location.

Also, for now, we have removed Situations availability in Google Play store for Russia and Belarus. That's completely insignificant, one might say, but in any case a signal of disapproval from our part to the Russian aggression. Please stop the madness.
