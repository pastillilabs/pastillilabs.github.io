Situations app simply **follows your instructions**. There is no AI or machine learning or snooping your private information involved - unless you specifically decide to use such a feature.

You can set up multiple **'situations'** which are collections of **'conditions'** and **'actions'**. A *'situation'* defines **what** happens and **when**.

**'Conditions'** can be anything from time periods & calendar events to device settings, connectivity and location.

**'Actions'** are typically different device settings or simple tasks like opening an application or sending SMS.
